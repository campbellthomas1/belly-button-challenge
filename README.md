# belly-button-challenge

### In this activity I took data from a belly button biodiversity dataset and looked at the mmicbrobial species present in more than 70% of people. I created bar and bubbles plots as well as a chart showing demographic data for all the different IDs. The chart updates when a new sample is selected and displays the top 10 samples values.
